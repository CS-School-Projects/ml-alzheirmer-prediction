# DCIT 313: Machine Learning 
# Alzheirmer Prediction
A machine learning model to predict whether an individual is demented based on MRI data

## Project: Predicting Alzheirmer Using MRI data

### Install
This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.



### Code

The solution code is provided in the `alzhermer_notebook.ipynb` notebook file and the MRI data is located at the `data/oasis_longitudinal.csv`.

### Running
Clone the repository and cd into it using the commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CS-School-Projects/ml-alzheirmer-prediction.git # Clone the repo
# cd into it
cd ml-alzheirmer-prediction
```

Open with Jupyter Lab
```bash
jupyter lab alzhermer_notebook.ipynb
```

Or Open with Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook alzhermer_notebook.ipynb
```
